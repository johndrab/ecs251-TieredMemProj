# **Project Summary: Optimizing Data Movement in Tiered Memory Systems**

## **Overview**
Our project focuses on optimizing data movement in tiered memory systems to enhance overall system performance. Traditional tiered memory management systems often struggle with inefficiencies due to their reliance on reactive policies, which are based on past access patterns. These approaches can fail to adapt to workloads with irregular or evolving memory access behaviors, leading to suboptimal performance.  

To address these shortcomings, we propose a **proactive and adaptive memory management policy** that dynamically optimizes data movement. Our approach will focus on minimizing page migration latency, reducing memory thrashing, and improving overall efficiency in tiered memory architectures.

## **Key Objectives**
- **Profiling Page Migration Latency:** Identify performance bottlenecks and analyze the impact of migration delays.
- **Targeted Optimizations:** Implement data movement strategies based on observed bottlenecks to improve memory access efficiency.
- **Threshold-Based Migration Policy:** Introduce adaptive migration thresholds to minimize excessive page movement and prevent thrashing.
- **Analysis of Reactive Policies:** Study existing reactive memory policies (e.g., TieredMMS) and evaluate their limitations in handling diverse workloads.
- **Development of Proactive Approaches:** Design a proactive memory management system that adjusts dynamically to evolving workload characteristics.

## **Addressing the Limitations of Existing Systems**
Current tiered memory systems, such as **TieredMMS**, rely on past access patterns to make migration decisions. While effective for predictable workloads, these systems may struggle with dynamic and irregular memory access behaviors. Our approach aims to provide:  
- **Greater Adaptability:** A policy that proactively adjusts to workload changes in real-time.  
- **Reduced Latency:** More efficient page migrations to enhance performance.  
- **Wider Applicability:** A memory management framework suitable for various applications and hardware configurations.  

## **Implementation and Infrastructure**
As part of our implementation, we will utilize **ExtMem** to handle memory management in user space, allowing us to bypass kernel-level constraints and directly control page migrations and data movement. This will enable us to design and test our custom memory policies with greater flexibility and precision.  

To develop and evaluate these policies, we plan to use **CloudLab**, a flexible testbed that provides access to the specialized hardware and operating system environments necessary for our work.
